## Project 1: Predict Gym Membership Level
For this project, I utilized a dataset from Kaggle, performed data cleaning, and transformed categorical columns into numeric values. I then generated a correlation matrix and heatmap to explore relationships between features. Next, I developed a predictive model to forecast membership type (Standard or Premium), evaluated its performance using accuracy scores, and implemented a user input interface to predict membership type for new members based on their provided information.
