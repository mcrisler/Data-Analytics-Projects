# A Collection of my Practice Files
## Project 1: Predict Gym Membership Level
For this project, I utilized a dataset from Kaggle, performed data cleaning, and transformed categorical columns into numeric values. I then generated a correlation matrix and heatmap to explore relationships between features. Next, I developed a predictive model to forecast membership type (Standard or Premium), evaluated its performance using accuracy scores, and implemented a user input interface to predict membership type for new members based on their provided information.

## Project 2: Predict Patient Risk of Heart Disease
In this project, I used medical data to predict the risk of heart disease in patients. The dataset contained missing values, which I handled by converting categorical variables to numeric and applying interpolation techniques. I then built a logistic regression model to classify patients into high or low-risk categories for heart disease. The model was evaluated using accuracy scores, and I demonstrated its application by making predictions based on new, unseen data to assess the patient's risk level.
